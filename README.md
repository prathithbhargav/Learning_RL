# Learning RL

This Repo contains the code for some of the RL Algorithms from the book - PyTorch 1.x Reinforcement Learning Cookbook by Yuxi (Hayden) Liu

While the algorithms in the book are from Pytorch 1.(x) and Open AI gym, I have used [Farama Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html) and [Pytorch 2.(x)](https://pytorch.org/). So the implementation might slightly be different. 

I have also consulted an online video- [Building a Custom Environment for Deep Reinforcement Learning with OpenAI Gym and Python - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD6V3rcr_54) for building a 'shower' environment where the goal is to make the agent learn to choose the right actions to get the proper temperature.
